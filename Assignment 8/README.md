On level 1 start with 1 red bubble that split to yellow and the yellow split to blue. All the bubbles with the same speed.
Level 2 start with 3 red bubbles that split to yellow and the yellow split to blue and blue split to gray. Bubbles speed increased from leavel 1 and also increase the speed after each split means that the smaller bubble is the fastest. 
Hits the bubbles with the chain cause the  bubble split to 2 and the the next two bubbles are smallers.

Didn't use any assets from store all the game objects crated in paint app the character and the wall images from google.
